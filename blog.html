                    Septicflesh (formerly known as Septic Flesh) are a symphonic death metal band from Greece, founded in 1990.<br>
                    Septicflesh were formed in Athens, March, 1990 by Sotiris Vayenas (guitar), Spiros Antoniou (bass and vocals), and Christos Antoniou (guitars), and quickly released a debut EP, Temple of the Lost Race in December, 1991. The band recorded their first full-length album Mystic Places of Dawn, in April 1994 at the Storm studio with the co-production of Magus Wampyr Daoloth (who previously was the Rotting Christ keyboardist).<br>

Session vocalist Natalie Rassoulis joined for The Ophidian Wheel (1997) and again for A Fallen Temple (1998).<br><br>

Split:<br>
The group split up in October 2003, and after the breakup, its members moved on to different or existing projects: Chris Antoniou continued involvement with Chaostar, which he formed in 1998, and Katsionis played guitar for Nightfall and keyboards for Firewind. TheDevilWorx formed a year after Septic Flesh's disbanding, and featured some members from Septic Flesh's original line-up. In March 2007, guitarist Sotiris Vayenas revealed his plans for a new solo project called Aenaos.<br><br>

Reunion :<br>
On February 19, 2007, Septic Flesh announced a reunion for Greece's Metal Healing Festival featuring Orphaned Land, Rage and Aborted, set to take place July 20–22.On April 3, 2007, Blabbermouth.net reported the band reunited for a seventh full-length CD, for French record label Season of Mist. According to guitarist and composer Christos Antoniou, the release would feature a full orchestra and a choir, totalling 80 musicians and 32 singers. Septic Flesh finalized the new album, Communion, in Studio Fredman in Sweden; it was released in April 2008. By this time the band had changed its name from Septic Flesh to Septicflesh. According to guitarist Christos it looks better and states a new phase in the band.<br><br>

On September 10, 2009, the band announced that they had begun work on a new studio album, tentatively planned for release in the beginning of 2011.<br>

On December 17, 2010, the band released the first single from the new batch of material titled "The Vampire From Nazareth" and announced that the new album will ship April 28 in the UK, and April 29 In the USA.<br>

On February 12, 2014, the band released details about their new album Titan.The album was released worldwide in June 2014.<br>

On December 15, 2014, it was announced that Kerim "Krimh" Lechner had joined Septicflesh as their new drummer, following the recent departure of their former longtime drummer, Fotis Benardo (a.k.a. Fotis Gianakopoulos).<br>

                    Psyclon Nine was a musical group formed in 2000 from San Francisco, California, United States. It was led by vocalist Marshall Goppert, under the stage name Nero Bellum. While their early efforts are generally categorized as aggrotech, later releases incorporated a disparate set of musical and aesthetic influences, notably black metal and industrial metal. They belonged to the so-called “second wave” of American harsh EBM, along with bands such as Dawn of Ashes, Die Sektor, and Tactical Sekt.<br>

The group went on their first hiatus at the end of 2010 due to Bellum’s opiate addiction, but returned to the stage in October 2011 for a performance in New York and released their final album Order of the Shadow: Act 1 in 2013.<br>

After Rotny Ford and Jon Siren quit the band in March 2014, Nero Bellum stated on his personal Facebook page that he wanted to perform one last series of concerts before putting an end to the band. Live band members Dorian Starchild (guitar), Brent Ashley (bass), and Kriz Dk (drums) joined Psyclon Nine for their final performances.<br>

A remix for the band Limnus entitled The Devils Are Inside the Walls (Psyclon Nine remix) was released in August 2014.It's unclear about the future of Psyclon Nine, but until something officially arises, the band remains on a second indefinite hiatus.<br>

                    Mayhem is a Norwegian black metal band formed (1984) in Oslo, regarded as one of the pioneers of the Norwegian black metal scene. Mayhem's career has been highly controversial, primarily due to their violent stage performances, the (1991) suicide of vocalist Per Yngve Ohlin ("Dead") and the (1993) murder of guitarist Øystein Aarseth ("Euronymous") by former member Varg Vikernes ("Count Grishnackh"), of Burzum.<br>

The group released a demo and an EP that were highly influential, and amassed a loyal following through sporadic and notorious live performances, attracting further attention through their ties to the string of Norwegian church burnings and the prominent incidents of violence surrounding them. They disbanded after Aarseth's murder, shortly before the release of their debut album, De Mysteriis Dom Sathanas, regarded as a classic of the black metal genre. Surviving former members Jan Axel Blomberg ("Hellhammer"), Jørn Stubberud ("Necrobutcher") and Sven Erik Kristiansen ("Maniac") reformed two years later with Rune Eriksen ("Blasphemer") replacing Aarseth. Attila Csihar and Krister Dreyer ("Morfeus") have since replaced Kristiansen and Eriksen, respectively.<br>

The band's music strongly influenced the black metal genre and was instrumental in moving the global heavy metal scene away from the prevailing trend for speed metal. Their post-Aarseth material is characterised by increased experimentation. The (2007) album, Ordo Ad Chao, received the Spellemannprisen award for best metal Album.<br>
